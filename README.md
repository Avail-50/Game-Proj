# Game-Proj

setting: inside steampunk

## Ava
- [x] movement and camera clean up 
- [x] dash / slide
- [ ] fix cursor???? idk if its like this usually but on my mac the sensitivity was way too low and the view would go in the direction of my cursor but not like a crosshair. crosshair would be ideal
- [ ] if ur bored, make character as ragdoll type with all the limbs and stuff and import mixamo animation (the ragdoll is important for swing)
- [ ] - wall movement ?

## Ellie
- [ ] first map (ellie? + playtesting)

## Fia
- [ ] swingin/grabber
- [ ] roll
- [ ] environment features - slide only on certain surfaces?

 (if we work on momnetum for the swinging, we could have some type of fall damage? when fall, lose momentum unless roll)
