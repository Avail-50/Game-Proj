# Game-Proj

setting: inside steampunk

## Ava
- movement and camera clean up
- dash / slide
- - wall movement ?

## Ellie
- first map (ellie? + playtesting)

## Fia
- swingin/grabber
- roll
- environment features - slide only on certain surfaces?

 (if we work on momnetum for the swinging, we could have some type of fall damage? when fall, lose momentum unless roll)
